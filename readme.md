## Prerequisites

1. [Windows Subsystem for Linux - Install for Windows 10](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install-win10) *if running Windows*
1. [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest#install-on-debianubuntu-with-apt-get) 
1. Azure Account: you can get a free one [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)

## The Process

### Login and Setup Hello World Python App

1. In a Web Browser Login to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
1. We will also like to work with Azure via the console so that we can automate things, so lets also login via the CLI.

    ```bash
    az login
    ```

    > The CLI will prompt you to open a web browser to [https://aka.ms/devicelogin](https://aka.ms/devicelogin) and enter a code. 

1. Lets take a look at all the subscriptions that we have access to with this account. If you have more than one ensure that the one you want to use today is set to default.

    ```bash
    az account list -o table
    ```

1. If the wrong subscrption is selected you can change it like this

    ```bash
    az account set -s 'My Subscription Name'
    ```

1. Create an Azure Resource Group to deploy our app into

    ```bash
    az group create --name svpdResourceGroup --location "South Central US"
    ```

1. Create an App Service Plan to deploy our app into

    ```bash
    az appservice plan create --name svpdAppServicePlan --resource-group svpdResourceGroup --sku FREE
    ```

1. Create a Web App do deploy our app into

    ```bash
    az webapp create --resource-group svpdResourceGroup --plan svpdAppServicePlan --name sweisfel-svpd --runtime "python|3.4"
    ```

    > NOTE: the name of your web app must be globally unique. For demo purposes I put my name in mine.

1. We can now open our web app in the browser, but we will need to know the defaul host name, you can get it from the json output from the prior setp or by running the followin command.

    ```bash
    az webapp show --resource-group svpdResourceGroup --name sweisfel-svpd
    ```

    > You should now see a Hello World type webpage telling you that your site online and setup to run python.

### Lets Setup Continuous deployment from our Git Repo to Azue Webapp

1. Every time we check code into our master brach on GitHub we want to notify our Azure Webapp. It will then pull our code over, compile it and update our site. 

    ```bash
    az webapp deployment source config --resource-group svpdResourceGroup --name sweisfel-svpd --repo-url https://github.com/shawnweisfeld/Smart-Video-Portal-Demo --branch master --repository-type github --git-token YOURKEY
    ```
    
    > Here we are setting up a super simple deployment, however in the real world we would likely want to deploy to multiple environments with signoffs between each. VisualStudio.com has a great build/release pipeline that can handle these more complex requirements. 

    > Generate the GitHub token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens). I gave mine the following permissions admin:repo_hook, notifications
